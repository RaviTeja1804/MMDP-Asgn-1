Only $2.99 a month Stand Up for Science rallies in Washington, D.C., and across the United States drew crowds of people worried about cuts to scientific funding. Logistical needs, like employment and housing, along with psychological needs must be met after disasters like the LA wildfires, research shows.

Advertisement Studies that touch on LGBT+ health, gender identity and DEI in the biomedical workforce could be terminated, according to documents obtained by Nature. Researchers at Stand Up for Science rallies voice defiance against the policies of US President Donald Trump’s administration. Analysis pokes holes in protocol that underpins Microsoft’s claim to have created the first topological qubits. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 releases T cells from immunosuppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2, thereby enhancing the immune response against metastasis. The US National Institutes of Health is terminating swathes of diversity- and climate-related grants. Plus, the second X chromosome in female cells might explain why women tend to be more resilient to cognitive decline than men. Andrew Robinson reviews five of the best science picks. Current approaches to pain relief are falling short. Chemically modifying a synthetic cannabinoid could enable scientists to capitalize on the body’s natural pain-killing pathway without evoking drug tolerance or psychoactivity. QLEDs — light-emitting diodes that rely on nanocrystals called quantum dots — are usually made with toxic heavy metals. A strategy has been developed to make QLEDs with a performance comparable to that of commercially available technologies but using a more environmentally friendly alloy of zinc, selenium, tellurium and sulfur, by improving the distribution of the tellurium atoms. To survive, animals must continually decide whether to persevere with their current goal, switch to a new one or disengage altogether. Three genetically defined types of neuronal cell in a small midbrain area called the median raphe nucleus are shown to control decisions about whether to persevere, explore or disengage. A compilation of genomes from species in the genusSolanumcould help scientists to blend the best aspects of productive staple crops and genetically diverse but under-studied indigenous crops. Nitrogen-isotope analysis provides geochemical evidence that, similar to modern corals, some extinct coral groups had a symbiotic association with photosynthetic microorganisms. This ‘photosymbiosis’ might have contributed to the high productivity of ancient reefs in low-nutrient environments and puts long-term ecological research on ancient reefs into a fresh perspective. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 releases T cells from immunosuppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2, thereby enhancing the immune response against metastasis. By suppressing compositional heterogeneities in cadmium-free quantum dots, environmentally friendly pure-blue-light-emitting diodes with enhanced efficiencies, lifetimes and spectral purity are achieved, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue quantum-dot light-emitting diodes. Analysis of gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars was accelerated using machine learning, enabling full low-latency parameter estimation and enhancing the potential for multi-messenger observations. cAMP produced by the TIR1/AFB receptors of the main endogenous developmental plant hormone auxin acts as a true second messenger, revising the established paradigm of transcriptional auxin signalling.
