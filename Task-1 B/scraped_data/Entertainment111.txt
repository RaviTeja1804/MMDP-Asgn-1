News, reviews and interviews from Austin's big festival Latest updates and tributes for the Oscar-winning actor All the winners, fashion and speeches from the big night The sci-fi comedy starring a dozen Robert Pattinsons was No. 1 at the domestic box office earning $19.1 million. But the Warner Bros. film cost $118 million. Matthew McConaughey talks about returning to acting with the drama 'The Rivals of Amziah King' and shares his take on 'True Detective: Night Country.'

Purple blood. And killer unicorns. That’s the recipe that made “Death of a Unicorn” one of the surprise discoveries at the SXSW Film & TV Festival… Dan Farah's film is full of U.S. officials who testify that we're being visited by other worlds. They make you wonder if the truth is still out there. 'Anora' won best picture, director, lead actress, original screenplay and editing. Baker ties Walt Disney for most Oscars won in a single night. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast Bong Joon Ho's disappointing follow-up to 'Parasite' has a dark look and blunt satire, but the prospect of an endless supply of gawping Robert Pattinson clones really starts to wear on us. In Rungano Nyoni's darkly transfixing drama, a group of young women, nursing the scars of sexual abuse, chafe against quiet complicity when their shared perpetrator drops dead. Woody Harrelson and Simu Liu in a true-life undersea rescue thriller that takes you down and lifts you up. It recreates a saturation-diving accident with a specificity that's nearly journalistic. Anthony Mackie's slyly dogged Captain America has less superpower than his predecessor, and so does the film. But it's just fun enough, as Harrison Ford plays a president with anger-management issues. 'Interior Chinatown' Struggles to Turn an Allegorical Novel Into a Show HBO Prequel Series 'Dune: Prophecy' Capably Tailors the Epic Franchise to Television Taylor Sheridan's 'Landman' Gives the West Texas Oil Fields the 'Yellowstone' Treatment Eddie Redmayne and Lashana Lynch's 'The Day of the Jackal' Is an Exhilarating Assassin Thriller Billie Eilish and producer Finneas keep up their winning streak with a surprising and intimate third album. Childish Gambino's latest is a masterpiece, and a kaleidoscopic showcase for his seemingly endless talents. Vince Staples searches for light on his new album, his most vulnerable project to date. Dua Lipa's new album is a joyous blast of pop savvy. Sam Gold's production is an actorly face-off between Jeremy Strong and Michael Imperioli, but the script ultimately let's the audience off the hook. Patricia Clarkson gives a luminous performance in an otherwise uneven revival of Eugene O'Neill's family drama. Strictly for the boomers. The stage adaptation has escapism, enchantment and heart, all elevated to new, literal heights that blend theater and cirque. Perfection is rarely achieved in movies, but this heaven-sent concert doc hits the sweet spot. Over two days in January 1972, the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin — she was 29 at the time — sweeps into the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts in front of a congregation and testifies to God in song. The blessed thing took nearly half a century to come out because director Sydney Pollack failed to sync the image with the sound. Then digital angels stepped in, and glory, glory, hallelujah!
