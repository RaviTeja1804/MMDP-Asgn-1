The food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe — it all comes from nature. Securing the health of Earth’s climate, ecosystems and biodiversity is essential to the well-being of all people. Worldwide, Conservation International is working to improve the lives of people everywhere by protecting oceans, forests and other living ecosystems. Teaser Thank you for watching the teaser We are protecting and restoring ecosystems including forests, mangroves and peatlands that absorb climate-warming carbon. Learn how we protect nature to stabilize the climate We aim to double the total amount of ocean area under protection, while developing innovative science to protect the high seas, coral reefs and mangroves that support all life on Earth. Learn how we protect the ocean We are helping countries build self-sustaining economies that are built on the protection, not the destruction, of nature.

Learn how we expand planet-positive economies Since 1987, Conservation International has combined fieldwork with innovations in science, policy and finance to secure the critical benefits that nature provides to humanity. Conservation International is behind some of the most extraordinary, cutting-edge conservation science taking place today. Our research is cited more than leading universities. From our launch of the world's first debt-for-conservation swap in 1987, Conservation International is changing the equation to make nature more valuable alive than destroyed. Respecting the rights of Indigenous people and local communities was one of our founding principles, and it guides our work to this day. Our science and expertise are helping governments take action to protect nature and the benefits it provides to people. Conservation International’s approach to conservation puts human well-being on equal footing with environmental goals. Werespect human rights, ensure our programs are designed withgender equalityin mind and create opportunities forlocal communities to earn a living while also helping nature.

The project aims to halt deforestation through the sale of carbon credits View all posts about: Climate Change “Invest in one woman, and that ripples out to her family, her community and beyond. It changes people’s lives.” View all posts about: Communities The CDC recently issued a warning to expect an increased risk of dengue — part of a worrying trend on a warming planet, where disease vectors like mosquitoes and ticks thrive.

And for want of a relatively small amount of money, its long-term health is in doubt. View all posts about: Biodiversity Pantry staples don’t get a lot of love. But for Sarela Herrada, they’re at the heart of a mission to support farming communities and make healthier, ethically-sourced foods more widely available.
