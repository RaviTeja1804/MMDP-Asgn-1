As the first-ever and most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines and shape the trajectory of the entire crypto market. First introduced in a whitepaper by ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ in 2008, and officially released to the world in January 2009 as the very first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was the first financial instrument of its kind to use cartography to record and send transactions over the blockchain. The fact that a currency could be transacted peer-to-peer away from central banks and had a permanent and publicly accessible ledger (in the form of the blockchain), was groundbreaking at the time, and it comes as no surprise that this new form of currency would grow in popularity as it did. As the first-ever and most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines and shape the trajectory of the entire crypto market. First introduced in a whitepaper by ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ in 2008, and officially released to the world in January 2009 as the very first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was the first financial instrument of its kind to use cartography to record and send transactions over the blockchain. The fact that a currency could be transacted peer-to-peer away from central banks and had a permanent and publicly accessible ledger (in the form of the blockchain), was groundbreaking at the time, and it comes as no surprise that this new form of currency would grow in popularity as it did. As a digital currency, Bitcoin does not need to be bought and sold in whole units and can be exchanged in fractions made up of satoshis (100 million satoshis make up one bitcoin). This is why despite there only ever being a finite pool of 21 million Bitcoins that can be created or mined, almost anyone can own some part of a Bitcoin. This finite pool also offers partial resistance to economic issues such as hyperinflation or a banking collapse. To some degree, this perhaps explains why Bitcoin’s adoption and appeal has become so widespread in the last few years. Let’s cover some brief history with this crypto. There was no funding round or launch in the manner we see with newer ICOs these days. The individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network back in 2009 when they mined the Bitcoin genesis block and the 50BTC first entered circulation at $0. Before the emergence of crypto exchanges, Bitcoin transactions weren’t easy, PayPal was one of the primary methods used to buy and sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin was being exchanged but it took until 2010 for the first Bitcoin transaction to take place (for a legitimate physical item). Laszlo posted in the ‘bitcointalk’ forum and ended up paying 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 Papa John’s pizzas (little did he know then! In his defence, this was a period, where Bitcoin was worth little to nothing). Following 2011, Bitcoin started to gain far more adopters and attention, with its earliest and more savvy adopters exploring its potential in web transactions. Several websites popped up allowing Bitcoin users to transact with their crypto for physical goods, which fuelled further adoption, and the very first Bitcoin price spike in 2013 where one Bitcoin would cost just over $1000. It was also around this period, that NewsBTC first started as a Bitcoin and crypto news outlet. 2014 marked a slight downturn in Bitcoin’s price trajectory, when one of the first crypto trading exchanges, Mt. Gox, suffered a security breach with hackers stealing $60 million, leading to the closure of the exchange and a slightly muted sentiment towards the cryptocurrency. Investor and user confidence did recover in the years following, with the price of bitcoin starting to break the $4000 mark in 2017 causing media coverage to grow and draw in more and more retail customers, Bitcoin finally surged to an incredible new all-time high of over $18,000 in December 2021. As the hype, continuous adoption around the world and price of Bitcoin have increased, coupled with the fact that financial institutions, Washington and the rest of the world governments are finally interested in its potential, it’s more important than ever to keep an eye on Bitcoin. Over the years, more and more physical and online stores have accepted it as payment, with financial institutions finally investing in it, and some countries accepting it as legal tender (El Salvador), Bitcoin can now be seen as a legitimate asset with all the features of a revolutionary new technology that will be here to stay for the long-haul. With the amount of Bitcoin that has already been mined to date, technological innovations such as the move from cold storage to wallets offered by crypto exchanges, overnight millionaires and the interest poured in from major financial institutions, it’s clear Bitcoin isn’t going away anytime soon. A recent surge in March 2024 gave Bitcoin another new all-time high (exceeding a value of over 73,000 USD), the lowered costs to transact, and the launch of new ETFs (exchange-traded funds) approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there’s greater consensus, that now is a more exciting time than ever for individuals and expert investors looking to get invested in digital assets like Bitcoin. Despite the obstacles, this crypto faced so far from hacks, security breaches, or even country-wide bans, Bitcoin’s ecosystem and infrastructure have evolved, with greater strides made in privacy, usability and improving scalability.
