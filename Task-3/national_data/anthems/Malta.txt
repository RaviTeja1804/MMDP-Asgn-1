Guard, Lord, forever, as you've done erst and ceasing never, This land whose name we received, our motherly-named Mother. Her you have draped with a light whose grace exceeds all other. On those who govern, sovereign God, bestow understanding, Grant wellness to those who work, largesse to those employing, Make firm, make just all our bonds, the peace we are enjoying.
