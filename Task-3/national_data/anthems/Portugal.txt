Heroes of the sea, noble people, Valiant and immortal nation, Raise once again today The splendor of Portugal! Among the haze of memory, Oh Fatherland, one feels the voice Of your distinguished forefathers, That shall lead you on to victory! To arms, to arms! Over land, over sea, To arms, to arms! For the Fatherland, fight! Against the cannons, march on, march on! Hoist the undefeated flag, In the lively light of your sky! May Europe cry out to the whole Earth: Portugal has not perished Kiss your merry ground The ocean, roaring with love, And your victorious arm Gave new worlds to the world! Salute the Sun that rises Over a gleeful future; Let the echo of an offense Be the sign for a comeback. Rays of this strong dawn Are like a mother's kisses, That keep us, sustain us, Against the injuries of fate.
