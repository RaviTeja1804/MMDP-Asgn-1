Around our flag we stand united, With one wish and one goal, A sacred oath we bestow upon it Proclaiming loyalty for our salvation. From war abstains only he, Who a traitor is born, He who is a true man is not frightened, But dies a warrior to the cause. With weapons in our hands a-brandished, We will defend our fatherland, Our sacred rights weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not relinquish, The foe has no place in our land. For God himself proclaimed The nations of the earth shall wane, And yet will live, will thrive Albania. For you, for you we fight. O Flag, flag, you sacred symbol Upon you we now swear For Albania, our dear fatherland For honour and your glory. Brave man is named and honoured The one who sacrificed himself for the fatherland Forever he will be remembered On earth and under as a saint!
