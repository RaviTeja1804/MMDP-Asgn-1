You ancient, you free, you mountainous north You quiet, you joyfully beauty! I greet you, loveliest land upon Earth, Your sun, your sky, your green climes. You throne on memories of great olden days, When honoured your name flew across the Earth, I know that you are and will become what you were, Yes, I want to live, I want to die in the North. I always will serve you my beloved land, your fidelity to death I will swear. Your right, I shall defend, with mind and with hand, your banner, high with feats it carries. With God I shall fight, for home and for hearth, for Sweden, the beloved homeland Exchange you, I won't for anything in this world No, I want live, I want to die in the North
