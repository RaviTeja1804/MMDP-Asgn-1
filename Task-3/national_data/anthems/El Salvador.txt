Let us salute the Fatherland, Proud to be called its children, And let us spiritedly swear our lives To consecrate its good without rest! Consecrate, consecrate Of the peace in the supreme happiness Ever noble El Salvador dreamed To achieve this has been Her eternal proposition, To keep it, Her greatest glory. And with unwavering faith, the path of progress She strives to follow, to follow To fulfil Her greatest destiny And conquer a happy future. A stern barrier protects Her Against the clash of vile disloyalty, Ever since the day when Her soaring Flag, Wrote "LIBERTY!" with Its blood. Freedom is Her dogma and Her guide; A thousand times She has managed to defended it, And as many times She repelled The hateful power of atrocious tyranny. bloody and sad her story is, Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant, A source of legitimate glory And a great lesson in spartan pride. Her innate bravery does not waver: In every man there is an immortal hero Who will know how to keep himself up to The proverbial valor of old. Proverbial valor. Proverbial valor. All are devoted and faithful To the tradition of warlike bravery With which they have always reaped fame By saving the Motherland's honour. To respect the rights of others And base Her actions on right and justice Is for Her, without infamous trickery, The constant and most firm ambition. And in following this line She persists, Dedicating her tenacious efforts In waging hard war to war; Her fortune is found in peace. Is found in peace. Is found in peace.
