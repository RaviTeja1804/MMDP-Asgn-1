Thousands of martyrs had died for thy cause, Thy sweeping plains had become fields of battle! And our warriors had bravely defended thee! Each one a hero in the storied annals of our land! Thou hast now become our rosegarden, Our hearts we are ever-ready to sacrifice! Thy neverÃ¢â‚¬â€œending love for us Hast earned thou a place in our hearts! To uphold thy honor, To keep thy flag waving, To uphold thy honor, The young stand at the ready! The glorious Fatherland! The glorious Fatherland! Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!
