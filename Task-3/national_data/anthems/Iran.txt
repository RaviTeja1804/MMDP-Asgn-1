Upwards on the horizon rises the Eastern Sun, The light in the eyes of the believers in justice, Bahman is the zenith of our faith. Your message, O Imam, of independence, freedom, is imprinted on our souls. O Martyrs! Your clamours echo in the ears of time. Enduring, continuing, and eternal. The Islamic Republic of Iran!
