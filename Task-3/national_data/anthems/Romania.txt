Awaken thee, Romanian, wake up from deadly slumber The scourge of inauspicious barbarian tyrannies And now or never to a bright horizon clamber That shall to shame put all your enemies. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now or never that we prove to the world That in these veins still flows Roman blood And in our hearts for ever we glorify a name Triumphant in battles, the name of Trajan. Behold, imperial shadows, Michael, Stephen, Corvinus At the Romanian nation, your mighty progeny With arms like steel and hearts of fire impetuous Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live in liberty, or dieÃ¢â‚¬Â that's what they all decree. Priests, raise the cross, as this army is Christian Give it liberty and it's sanctified scope WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather die in battle, with honorary glory Than live again enslaved on our ancestral land.
