Oh, bright dawn of May. Our mother Montenegro. We are sons of your rocks And keepers of your honesty We love you, the rocky hills And your awesome gorges That never came to know The chains of shameful slavery. Our mother Montenegro! Oh, bright dawn of May. Our mother Montenegro. While our unity gives wings to our LovÃ„â€¡en cause, Proud shall be, celebrated will be Our dear homeland. A river of our waves, Jumping into two seas, Will bear voice to the ocean, May eternal be our Montenegro! Will bear voice to the ocean, May eternal be our Montenegro!
