God bless our homeland Ghana, And make our nation brave and strong, Bold to defend forever The cause of Freedom and of Right. Fill our hearts with true humility Make us cherish fearless honesty, And help us to resist oppressors' rule With all our will and might forever more . Hail to thy name, O Ghana To thee we make our solemn vow; Steadfast to build together A nation strong in Unity; With our gifts of mind and strength of arm, Whether night or day, in the midst of storm, In every need whatever the call may be, To serve thee, Ghana, now and evermore.Raise high the flag of Ghana, And one with Africa advance; Black star of hope and honor, To all who thirst for liberty;
