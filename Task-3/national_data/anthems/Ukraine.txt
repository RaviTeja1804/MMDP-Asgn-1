Ukraine's glory, Ukraine's freedom did not disappear, Fate will smile on us Ukrainians, our skies will be clear. Our enemies will vanish like a sun-dried foam, We will be the only masters in our dear home. We will give our souls and bodies for our freedom And will show that we are, brothers, in the Cossack breed born!
