Lord bless Africa May her glory be lifted high, Hear our prayers Lord bless us, your children. Lord we ask You to protect our nation, Intervene and end all conflicts, Protect us, protect our nation, Protect South Africa, South Africa. Out of the blue of our heavens, From the depths of our seas, Over our everlasting mountains, Where the echoing crags resound, Sounds the call to come together, And united we shall stand, Let us live and strive for freedom, In South Africa our land.
