Glad Joyous Guatemala! may your altar Never be trampled by the tormentor Nor may slaves lick the yoke Nor may tyrants spit upon your face If tomorrow your sacred soil By foreign invasion is threatened Free into the wind, your beautiful flag To victory or death it shall call Free into the wind, your beautiful flag To victory or death it shall call Your people will, with fiery soul, die before being enslaved. From your old and hard chains You forged, with an ire-driven hand, The plow that fertilizes the soil And the honor-saving sword. Our fathers fought one day, Lit up in patriotic burning And they managed, without bloody clash, To place you on a throne of love. And they managed, without bloody clash, To place you on a throne of love, And our Nation, in energetic assent, Gave life to the redeeming ideal. Your emblem is a piece of the sky From which a cloud gets its whiteness And woe onto him who dares in blind madness your colours to stain! For your sons, brave and zealous, who adore peace as a great treasure will never avoid the rough battle to defend their land and their home. They will never avoid the rough battle to defend their land and their home as well as the altar of the mother country, their altar. Lying upon the proud Ande, of the two oceans, hearing its noise, under the gold and crimson red wing of the beautiful quetzal you will become entranced. Native bird that lives in your seal the protector of your soil May it fly high more than the condor and the royal eagle! May it fly high more than the condor and the royal eagle And in its wings, may it raise up to the sky Guatemala, your name, immortal!
