O dear Belgium, O holy land of the fathers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Our soul and our heart are devoted to you! With blood to spill for you, O fatherland! We swear with one cry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ You shall live! So gladly bloom in beauty full, Into what freedom has taught you to be, And evermore shall sing your sons: The King, the Law, the Liberty! Faithful to the word that you may speak boldly, For King, for Freedom and for Law! To Law and King and Freedom, hail! The King, the Law, the Liberty
