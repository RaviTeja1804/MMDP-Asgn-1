O our land Finland, our land of birth, sound, the golden word! There's no valley, no hill no water, shore more precious than this northern homeland the dear land of our fathers! Our land is poor, so it remains, if you long for gold A stranger sure abandons it, but to us, the most precious land is this, its wilds, islands, mainlands, to us, they are golden. They are dear to us our rapids with their surges the hummings of eternal pines our starnights, the summers bright all that with their pictures and songs closed to heart. Here with ploughs, swords, thoughts our fathers fought, when the day hid in the clouds or shone with shines of happiness here the nation of Finland, the most difficult troubles they experienced. This nation's battles who can tell them, who? When a war sounded in our valleys, and frost brought the pain of hunger, who measured the blood and its sufferings? Here has its blood flown for our sake, too here has it enjoyed its happiness and sighed its worries that nation, to which the most ancient burden of ours was given. Here we have a feeling excellent and everything favourable, although be it whatever luck land fatherland is what we have. What's sweeter in the world and what's more precious? And here is this land, our eyes see it. We can reach out a hand and point at water, shore and say: see, there's our father's dearest land. If we were accompanied to glory even to golden clouds, where we wouldn't cry but most important joy the soul would get, to this poor home our will would be. The homeland of truth and poet the land with a thousand lakes where our life gets protection, you the land of memories and hopes, always be, content with your luck, free and joyful. Your prosperity from its hide shall break out once yet our love it shall rise your hope, joy in its brilliance, and once, your song, the land of birth shall get the highest echo.
