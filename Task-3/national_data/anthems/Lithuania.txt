Lithuania, our dear homeland, Land of worthy heroes! May your sons draw strength From your past experiences. May your children always Choose the paths of virtue, May they work towards your good, And that of all people. May the sun of Lithuania Disperse darkness, And light, and truth, May guide our steps. May love of Lithuania Burn in our hearts, In the name of Lithuania, Unity may blossom!
