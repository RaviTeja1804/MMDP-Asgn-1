Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people, Dispenser of India's destiny. Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sindh,  Gujarat and Maratha, Of the Dravida and Odisha and Bengal; It echoes in the hills of Vindhya and the Himalayas, Mingles in the music of Ganga and Yamuna and is chanted by The waves of the Indian sea. They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise. The saving of all people waits in thy hand, Thou dispenser of India's destiny. Victory, victory, victory to thee
