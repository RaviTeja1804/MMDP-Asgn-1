Soldiers of Vietnam, marching onward United in determination to save the nation, Our steps resound on the long and arduous road. Our flag, red with the blood of victory, bears the spirit of the country. The distant rumbling of guns mingles with our marching song. The path to glory is built by the bodies of our foes. Overcoming all hardships, together we build our resistance bases. Ceaselessly for the People's cause let us struggle, Let us hasten to the battlefield! Onward! All together advancing! For one eternal Vietnam.
