The placid shores of the Ipiranga heard the resounding shout of a heroic folk And the sun of Liberty in shining beams shone in the homeland's sky at that instant If the pledge of this equality we managed to conquer with strong arm In thy bosom, O Freedom, our chest defies death itself! O beloved, idolized homeland, Hail, hail! Brazil, an intense dream, a vivid ray of love and hope descends to earth If in thy beautiful, smiling and limpid sky the image of the (Southern) Cross blazes. Giant by thine own nature Thou art beautiful, strong, a fearless colossus And thy future mirrors that greatness Adored Land Amongst thousand others art thou, Brazil, O beloved homeland Of the sons of this ground Thou art kind mother Beloved homeland, Brazil Eternally lying on splendid cradle to the sound of sea and under deep sky light Thou flashest, Brazil, crocket of America, illuminated by the sun of New World Than the more garish land, thy smiling, pretty prairies have more flowers "Our groves have more life" "Our life" in thy bosom "more loves" O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail! Brazil, of eternal love be a symbol the starred labarum which thou displayst And say the laurel-green of this pennant "Peace in the future and glory in the past" But if thou raisest the strong mace of justice, see that a son of thine flees not from battle, nor do those who love thee fear their own death Adored Land Amongst thousand others art thou, Brazil, O beloved homeland Of the sons of this ground thou art kind mother Beloved homeland, Brazil
