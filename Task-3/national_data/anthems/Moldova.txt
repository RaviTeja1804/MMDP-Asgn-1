A treasure is our language that surges From deep shadows of the past, Chain of precious stones that scattered All over our ancient land. A burning flame is our language Amidst a people waking From a deathly sleep, no warning, Like the brave man of the stories. Our language is the greenest leaf Of the everlasting codrii, Gentle river Dniester's ripples Hiding starlight bright and shining. Our language is more than holy, Words of homilies of old Wept and sung perpetually In the homesteads of our folks. A treasure will spring up swiftly From deep shadows of the past, Chain of precious stones that scattered All over our ancient land.
