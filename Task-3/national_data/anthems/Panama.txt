At last we reached victory In the joyous field of the union; With ardent fires of glory A new nation is alight. It is necessary to cover with a veil The past times of Calvary and cross; Let now the blue skies be adorned with The splendid light of the concord. Progress caresses your path. To the rhythm of a sublime song, You see both your seas roar at your feet Giving you a path to your noble mission. In your soil covered with flowers To the kisses of the warm terrestrial breeze, Warrior roars have ceased; Only fraternal love reigns. Ahead the shovel and pick, At work without any more dilation, and we will be as such at work and gala of this fruitful world of Columbus.
