Woven from hundreds of flowers, we are one garland that's Nepali Spread sovereign from Mechi to Mahakali. A shawl of nature's wealth unending From the blood of the braves, a nation free and non-moving. A land of knowledge, of peace, the plains, hills and mountains tall Indivisible, this beloved land of ours, our motherland Nepal. Of many races, languages, religions, and cultures of incredible sprawl This progressive nation of ours, all hail Nepal!
