Glory to the brave people which shook off the yoke, the Law respecting virtue and honour. Down with the chains! Cried out the Lord; and the poor man in his hovel for freedom implored. Upon this holy name trembled in fear the vile selfishness that had once triumphed. Glory to the brave people which shook off the yoke, the Law respecting virtue and honour. Let's cry out aloud:  Down with oppression!  Faithful countrymen, your strength lies in your unity; and from the heavens the supreme Creator breathed a sublime spirit into the nation. Glory to the brave people which shook off the yoke, the Law respecting virtue and honour. United by bonds made by heaven, all America exists as a Nation; and if tyranny raises its voice, follow the example given by Caracas.
