Until the day when the East Sea's waters and Mt. Baekdu are dry and worn away, God protect and preserve us. Long live our nation!   Three thousand Li of splendid rivers and mountains, filled with Roses of Sharon; Great Korean People, stay true to the Great Korean way.   The pine tree atop foremountain stands firmly unchanged under wind and frost as if wrapped in armour, as is our resilient spirit.   Three thousand Li of splendid rivers and mountains, filled with Roses of Sharon; Great Korean People, stay true to the Great Korean way.   Autumn sky is void and vast, high and cloudless, the bright moon is our heart, undivided and true.   Three thousand Li of splendid rivers and mountains, filled with Roses of Sharon; Great Korean People, stay true to the Great Korean way.   With this spirit and this mind, give all loyalty, in suffering or in joy, love the country.   Three thousand Li of splendid rivers and mountains, filled with Roses of Sharon; Great Korean People, stay true to the Great Korean way. https://lyricstranslate.com
