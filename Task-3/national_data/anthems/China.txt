Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves; With our very flesh and blood Let us build our new Great Wall! The peoples of China are in the most critical time, Everybody must roar his defiance. Arise! Arise! Arise! Millions of hearts with one mind, Brave the enemy's gunfire, March on! Brave the enemy's gunfire, March on! March on! March on, on!
