There is a lovely country it stands with broad beech-trees, near the salty eastern shore It bends itself in hill, valley, its name is old Denmark and it is the hall of Freya. There sat in former times, the armour-suited warriors, rested from conflict Then they went forward to the enemies' injury, now their bones are resting behind the mound's menhir. That country is still lovely, because the sea waves so blue frolic, and the foliage stands so green And noble women, beautiful maidens, and men and brisk swains inhabit the Danes' islands. Hail king and fatherland! Hail every honourable citizen, who works, what he can Our old Denmark shall endure, as long as the beech-tree mirrors its top in the blue wave!
