When the morning skies grow red, and over us their radiance shed Thou, O Lord, appeareth in their light when the alps glow bright with splendor, pray to God, to Him surrender for you feel and understand that He dwelleth in this land. In the sunset Thou art night and beyond the starry sky Thou, O loving father, ever near, when to Heaven we are departing joy and bliss Thou'lt be imparting for we feel and understand that Thou dwellest in this land. When dark clouds enshroud the hills and gray mist the valley fills yet Thou art not hidden from thy sons pierce the gloom in which we cower with Thy sunshine's cleansing power then we'll feel and understand that God dwelleth in this land
