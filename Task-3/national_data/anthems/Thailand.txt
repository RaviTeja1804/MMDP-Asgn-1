Thailand unites the flesh and blood of Thais. The land of Thailand belongs to the Thais. Long has been our independence, wish sovereignty allowed to maintain it, Because Thais have been united forever. The Thais are peaceful and loving, but are not cowards in war. Our sovereignty will never be threatened, We will sacrifice every drop of our blood for our nation. We are ready to die for freedom, security, and prosperity!
