Our beautiful homeland, Oh so fearless and gracious, Our fathers' ancient glory, May you be happy forever. Dear, you are our only glory, Dear, you are our only one, Dear, we love your plains, Dear, we love your mountains. Drava, Sava, keep on flowing, Danube, do not lose your vigour, Deep blue sea, tell the world, That the Croat loves his people. Whilst his fields are kissed by sunshine, Whilst his oaks are whipped by bura winds, Whilst his ancestors lie buried, Whilst his living heart beats.
