Live, my country, the unity of our Emirates. You have lived for a nation, Whose religion is Islam, and whose guide is the Qur'an. I made you stronger in the name of God, O homeland. My country, my country, my country, my country. May God protect you from the evil through all times.We have vowed to build and work. Work sincerely, work sincerely, As long as we live we'll be sincere, sincere.May safety last, and the flag rise, O Emirates. Symbol of Arabness. We all make sacrifices for you, we supply you with our blood. We sacrifice for you with our souls, O homeland.
