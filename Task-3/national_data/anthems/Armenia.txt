Our Fatherland, free, independent, That has for centuries lived, Is now summoning its sons To the free, independent Armenia. Here is a flag for you, my brother, That I have sewn by hand Over the sleepless nights, And bathed in my tears. Look at it, tricolored, A valuable symbol for us. Let it shine against the enemy. Let you, Armenia, be glorious forever. Death is the same everywhere, A man dies but once, Blessed is the one that dies For the freedom of his nation.
