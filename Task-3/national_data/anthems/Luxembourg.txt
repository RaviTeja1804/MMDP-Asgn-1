Where the Alzette flows through the meadows The Sauer breaks its way through the rocks; Where the vines amply grow along the Moselle, the sky makes wine for us That is our country for which we give down here we would risk everything; Our homeland so deeply we carry in our hearts. In its crown of dark wood always guarded by peace, Without pomp and costly shine Cozy it cutely smiles. Its people can claim happiness There are no hollow dreams: If you live in such a home, How good it is to be at Home. Sing, sing, through mountain and valley The earth that bore us, That love loyally echoes Borne in each breast. For our homeland, no melody is too beautiful Every word that is uttered Shakes the soul like a thunderclap And our eyes shine like fire. O Thou above whose hand is Leading the nations of the world; Protect this land of Luxembourg From foreign yoke and pain You have given us already in our youth The sense of liberty. Let the sunlight of freedom shine that we have seen for such a long time.
