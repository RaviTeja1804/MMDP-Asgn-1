Poland has not yet died, So long as we still live. What the foreign power has seized from us, We shall recapture with a sabre. March, march, Dabrowski, To Poland from the Italian land. Under your command We shall rejoin the nation. We'll cross the Vistula, we'll cross the Warta, We shall be Polish. Bonaparte has given us the example Of how we should prevail. Like Czarniecki to PoznaÃ…â€ž Returned across the sea To save his homeland After the Swedish partition. The German nor the Muscovite will settle When, with a backsword in hand, "Concord" will be everybody's watchword And so will be our fatherland. A father, in tears, Says to his Basia Listen, our boys are said To be beating the tarabans. All exclaim in unison, "Enough of this captivity!" We've got the scythes of RacÃ…â€šawice, KoÃ…â€ºciuszko, if God wills.
