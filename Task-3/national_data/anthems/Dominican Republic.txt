Brave , Let’s raise our song with vivid emotion, From the world to the face of the earth Show our unconquered glorious banner. Hail, the nation who strong and intrepid, Into war launched itself set to die When in a warring challenge to the death Its chains of slavery still it cut off. No people deserves to be free If it’s an indolent slave and servile; If in its chest doesn't grow the flame that forged virile heroism. But the brave and indomitable Always proudly her forehead will raise For if she were a thousand times a slave This many times to be free she will know. And if fraud and cunning exposed her To disdain of an intrusive man, Las Carreras! Beler!...were fields Which covered in glory were seen. At the top of our heroic bastion, Word of the free was materialized, Where the genius of Sanchez and Duarte Taught us to be free or to die. And if could inconsiderate leader Reduce the luster of these glories, Of the war seen in Capotillo The banner of fire waves on. And the fire that leaves shocked The arrogant lion from Castile, Removes it from glorious beaches to Where floats the banner that’s crossed. Compatriots, let’s show erect our Forehead, proud of today for; will be destroyed But slave again, never. That every chest is of love a sanctuary Where one feels the homeland lives; It is the law her invincible shield; It is her motto be free or die. Liberty that still serenely lifts up Victory in her triumphal carriage. The trumpet of war still resounds Proclaiming her immortal glory Liberty! Let the echoes agitate While full of noble anxiety Our battlefields of glory repeat Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!
