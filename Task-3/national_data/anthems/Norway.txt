Yes, we love with fond devotion This our land that looms Rugged, storm-scarred o'er the ocean With her thousand homes. Love her, in our love recalling Those who gave us birth. And old tales which night, in falling, Brings as dreams to earth. Norseman, whatsoe'er thy station, Thank thy God whose power willed and wrought the land's salvation In her darkest hour. All our mothers sought with weeping And our sires in fight, God has fashioned in His keeping Till we gained our right. Yes, we love with fond devotion This our land that looms Rugged, storm-scarred o'er the ocean With her thousand homes. And, as warrior sires have made her Wealth and fame increase, At the call we too will aid her Armed to guard her peace.
